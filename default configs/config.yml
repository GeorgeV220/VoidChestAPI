  # WARNING: Only use this feature if you know what you're doing.
  #
  # In case of you having issues with voidchests being deleted upon a restart, increase the number by a bit.
  #
  # How many seconds should the plugin wait before loading data (voidchests, player related data, etc.)
  # This will allow worlds and other things to load before voidchest so that you can avoid issues such as voidchest
  # attempting to load voidchests in worlds that have yet to load.
  #
  # This should only be modified if servers are having issues with worlds loading after the voidchest plugin has loaded.
  # Recommended load-delay interval is any number from 1 to 10, the highest, the more time the data will delay to load.
  #
  # Any number that is < 1 will make the plugin instantly load data when the plugin enabled as well.
  # Is NOT RECOMMENDED to set this to < 2.
  load delay: 5

  # WARNING: Only use this feature if you fully understand the implications.
  # In VoidChest 6.0 and later, this setting controls the interval at which changes are batched and saved.
  # The value represents the time (in SECONDS) between automatic saves of player and voidchest data.
  # The primary benefit of batching saves is to reduce performance overhead by saving changes less frequently,
  # rather than saving each change individually.
  #
  # However, please note: If the server crashes before changes are saved, you may lose unsaved data.
  #
  # The reason for introducing this feature is that, in previous versions, concurrent saves to the disk could occur
  # if one save operation was in progress while another change was made.
  # This could lead to file corruption, as two threads would be attempting to write to the same file simultaneously.
  #
  # Recommended Usage:
  # - Set a reasonable save interval to balance between performance and data safety.
  # - If you're running a highly active server with frequent changes, consider a lower save interval to reduce data loss risk.
  save interval: 20  # Time in SECONDS between saves. Adjust based on server load and performance needs.
